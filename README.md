## Project Description

- The goal of this project was to practice interpreting different types of visualizations by collecting relevant information about players from different teams  playing during the year of 2019 in Primeira Liga, in order to compare and analyse the differences between their variables.


- The commands assume a basic understanding of the Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

## Data

The data used in this project was collected from:

- `FIFA 19 complete player dataset` - a free dataset from Kaggle containing 18k+ FIFA 19 players and ~90 attribute points extracted from the latest FIFA database




## Workflow

The project follows three essential steps: 
- **1) Data Cleaning**, 
- **2) Data Manipulation** and 
- **3) Data Visualization** - in order to make it easy to keep track of changes and better structure the clean data set.


### Step 1 - ` Data Cleaning`

- using the given dataset, it is possible to get a clear idea of how each row is characterised given the original column names; 

- since the objective is to interpretate a few attritubes from the list, we will begin by cleaning those which do not support our analysis.

1.1 - Dataset exploration
1.2 - Data Cleaning

### Step 2: `Data Manipulation`:

- resorting to each teams's attributes, it is possible to draw conclusions by comparing their average and specific team values

- identifying potential correlations between variables; 

- using a list of the top 5 teams in Primeira Liga, comparing differences between the average player attribute's that plays on each of them;



### Step 3: `Data Visualization`:

The plots created included:

- Distribution of Fifa Rating in Primeira Liga
- Distribution of Age in Primeira Liga
- Visual correlation of Age with other variables
- Visual correlation of Fifa Rating with other variables


## Results

- Clean data set containing all the attributes from each of the players from the teams that we analysed;
- Set of figures that help visualize the results and draw conclusions about the dataset


## Deliverables
- `players.csv` - with all the data collected from Kaggle
- `Primeira_Liga.ipynb` - containing all the code that built the project
- `figures` - containing the product of all the visualization that supported the project
